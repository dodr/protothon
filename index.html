    <p>Spotify has opened up their API's. This is exciting. But what can we actually do with them?</p>
    <p>Protothon will explore the creative potential of this in a 12 hour event where inter-disciplinary teams of creatives and coders will prototype their asses off to invent the answer.</p>
    <p>Some fine people from Spotify will be present at the event to teach us all we need to know about Spotify apps.</p>
